# Real-Time Computer Control Systems (ELE 709)
This project shell deals with practical techniques for the specification, design and imple-
mentation of real-time computer control systems. Fundamental concepts in concur-
rent programming are also demonstrated in this project.  Techniques such as concurrent programs in the C language using
POSIX threads (pthreads) are also utlized.

This project contains my own personal work from the Ryerson Engineering course ELE 709.
